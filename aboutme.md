I learned to knit as a small child, although it grew into more of a “lifestyle choice” than a hobby by my early 20s. Around this time, I also learned about to dye, spin, crochet and weave, although knitting remains my core love. 

The other thing you need to know about me is that I am a huge data nerd. I started researching knitting for my sociology thesis on gender and knitting, and haven't seemed to be able to stop.  Most of my research these days uses my data science and programming skills to explore the modern knitting community. 

If you ever want to geek out over data stuff or yarn (or both!), feel free to drop me a line at any of the contact details below.
