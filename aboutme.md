I learned to knit as a small child, although it grew into more of a “lifestyle choice” than a hobby by my early 20s. Around this time, I also learned about to dye, spin, crochet and weave, although knitting remains my core love.

I first used Python to send my brother an annoying number of Lilo and Stitch Gifs over Slack, then discovered that there could be real world applications. Since then, I've started to use Python, mostly for data analysis, in my real-world job, and for personal projects.

I like to bring together my knitting interests and data science and programming. I started researching knitting for my sociology thesis on gender and knitting, and haven't seemed to be able to stop. Most of focus these days are on trending within the online knitting community, and using LaTex to make pattern publication easier and more consistent.

If you ever want to geek out over data stuff or yarn (or both!), please drop me a line at any of the contact details below.
